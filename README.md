Welcome to Iron of Hearts. This mod has no lore and is basically a shitpost.
Thank you for direct installing it is very good and makes me happy
I'll probably make a discord if this mod is any good (which it isn't)

This mod is old and has not been worked on in over a year. It will never be updated to run on modern hoi4 versions unfortunately and was poorly designed.
If anyone else wants to take over this mod, that's allowed.
